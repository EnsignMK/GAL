# 🧬 Game of Life Launcher (GAL)

## 📌 Overview
Game of Life Launcher (GAL) is a Godot-based simulation of Conway’s Game of Life. It provides an interactive way to create, manipulate, and observe evolving cellular automata on a tilemap. Users can place patterns, save and load them, adjust the simulation speed, and manage their pattern collection.

The core logic is inside the dev/ folder, while the exp/ folder contains remnants of earlier iterations and testing files.

## 🎮 Features
- 🟢 **Create & Place Patterns** – Add patterns on the tilemap.
- 🎬 **Start Simulation** – Watch patterns evolve based on Conway’s rules.
- ⏩ **Speed Control** – Adjust simulation speed.
- ❌ **Delete All** – Clear the screen instantly.
- 📂 **Pattern Selection Menu** – Choose from **pre-saved** or **custom patterns**.
- ✏️ **Pattern Editor (inside Pattern Selection Menu)** – Design and save your own patterns.
- 💾 **Save & Load Patterns** – Store and reuse patterns.
- 🗑 **Manage Patterns** – Remove specific saved patterns.
